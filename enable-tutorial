## setup the TUTROOT directory, you may want to make this an absolute path
export TUTROOT=`cd ../..;pwd`

## setup the gopath correctly
## the first element in gopath is for external dependencies and 
## 'go get' will install things there.  order of these matters.
export GOPATH=$TUTROOT/external:$TUTROOT


## this should point to your go install if it is not installed in a 
## a system-wide location (ala via brew)
#export GOROOT=~/go14.src/go

## the path needs to include go1.4+
##
## you should put the exact path you want to use in here, don't use 
## PATH=$PATH:...  because that will bite you later.

##if you set GOROOT
## export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$PWD/external/bin
## otherwise
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:$TUTROOT/external/bin:$TUTROOT/bin

## ENVIRONMENT FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

export FRESNO_TEST=true  ##allows you to differentiate running on heroku or not
export HEROKU_NAME=damp-sierra-7161 ##put your heroku app name

### It is actually a good idea to run on a different port (not 5432) to 
### prevent your application from interfering with other things that expect
### postgres to be on the standard port.
export PGPORT=5432
